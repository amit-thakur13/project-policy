<br/><br/>Disputes (Resolutions) Policy
<br/><br/>Overview
<br/><br/>Generally, transactions are conducted smoothly on Jokester. However, there may be some cases where both the Buyers and Sellers may face issues. At Jokester, we have a Dispute Resolution process in order to resolve disputes between Buyers and Sellers.
<br/><br/>What is a 'dispute'?
<br/><br/>A 'Dispute' can be defined as a disagreement between a Buyer and a Seller in connection with a transaction on the Website.
<br/><br/>How does a 'dispute' occur in the Marketplace?
<br/><br/>Disputes are filed as a result of a disagreement between the Buyer and the Seller. Disputes arise out of an issue that is raised by either party not being completely satisfied with the resolution of their complaint/issue.
<br/><br/>It is important that before a Buyer/Seller raises a dispute, they should attempt to solve the issue. Please note that whenever a Buyer raises a dispute, the Seller's payment for that order is put on hold immediately until the issue is resolved.
<br/><br/>How is a 'dispute' created?
<br/><br/>Whenever there is a disagreement, the Buyer can write to<text style={hs1}> dispute@Jokester.com, while the Seller can write to ss@Jokester.com, in order to raise a dispute. Disputes can be raised at a particular transaction level.</text>
<br/><br/>What are the various types of 'disputes'?
<br/><br/>Following are the indicative examples of potential disputes:
<br/><br/>1. Wrong item received
2. Item Not as described
<br/><br/>•	Damaged or Seal broken on Product
•	Part/Accessory missing
•	Item not Compatible
•	Seller Description/Specification Wrong
•	Defective (Functional issues)
•	Product not working and Manufacturer claims invalid Invoice
<br/><br/>In case the Seller rejects the return request of the Buyer, and Buyer raises a dispute, then Jokester will try to mediate and resolve the dispute between both the parties. If the dispute is resolved in favor of the Buyer, a refund is provided once the product is returned to the Seller. If the dispute is settled in favor of the Seller, Buyer is entitled to any refund. 
<br/><br/>
Buyer Protection Program
<br/><br/>In case of a dispute where the Seller is unable to provide a refund or a replacement, Jokester will actively work towards reaching a resolution.
<br/><br/>The Buyer Protection Program covers Buyers who are unable to successfully resolve their dispute with the Seller or are not satisfied the resolution provided by the Seller.
<br/><br/>The Buyer can write <text style={hs1}>to resolution@Jokester.com if the issue with the Seller is not resolved. Jokester’s Customer Support team will look into the case to check for possible fraud and if the Buyer has been blacklisted/blocked from making purchases on the Website. Only after verifying these facts, a dispute can be registered.</text>
<br/><br/>In due course of resolution, Jokester’s Customer Support Team will facilitate a conference call including the Seller and the Buyer.
<br/><br/>When a dispute has been raised, Jokester may provide both the parties access to each other’s Display Names, contact details including email addresses and other details pertaining to the dispute. Buyers and Sellers are subject to final consent from Jokester for settling the dispute.

<text style={hs1}>Jokester Infringement Verification (FIV) – Reporting Listing Violations</text>
<br/><br/>Jokester has put in place Jokester Infringement Verification process so that intellectual property owners could easily report listings that infringe their rights. It is in Jokester’s interest to ensure that infringing products are removed from the site, as they erode Buyer and good Seller trust.
<br/><br/>•	If you are a Verified Rights Owner and want to report a listing issue, see Jokester’s FIV. Note: Only the intellectual property rights owner can report potentially infringing products or listings through FIV. If you are not the intellectual property rights owner, you can still help by getting in touch with the rights owner and encouraging them to contact us.
•	If your listing was removed through FIV, and you believe that your listing was removed in error, please contact us.
<br/><br/>Jokester does not and cannot verify that Sellers have the right or ability to sell or distribute their listed products. However, Jokester is committed to removing infringing or unlicensed products once an authorized representative of the rights owner properly reports them to Jokester.
<br/><br/>FIV works to ensure that item listings do not infringe upon the copyright, trademark or other intellectual property rights of third parties. FIV participants have the ability to identify and request removal of allegedly infringing products and materials.
<br/><br/>Any person or company who holds intellectual property rights (such as a copyright, trademark or patent) which may be infringed upon by products listed on Jokester is encouraged to become a FIV member.

The information requested by the Notice of Infringement is designed to ensure that parties reporting products are authorized by the rights owners, and to enable Jokester to easily identify the material or listing to be ended.
